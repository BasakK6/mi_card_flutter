# Mi Card

## Our Goal

Now that we've seen how to create a Flutter app entirely from scratch, we're going to go further and learn more about how to design user interfaces for Flutter apps.

## What you will create

Mi Card is a personal business card. Imagine every time someone wants our contact details or our business card but you we didn't have it on us. Well, now we can get them to download our business card as an app.

## What I learnt

* How to create Stateless Widgets
* What is the difference between hot reload and hot refresh and running an app from cold
* How to use Containers to lay out the UI
* How to use SafeArea widget
* How to use Flutter Inspector
* How to use Columns and Rows to position the UI elements
* How to use CircleAvatar widget
* How to add custom fonts from fonts.google.com
* How to add Material icons
* How to style Text widgets
* How to use Padding widget
* How to use Card widget 
* How to use ListTile widget
* How to read and use Flutter Documentation
